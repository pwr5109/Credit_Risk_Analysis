# Overview
The purpose of this analysis is to employ supervised machine learning techniques in order to assess credit risk. Assessing credit risk is characteristically tricky because low risk loans vastly outnumber risky loans. To account for this we have tested six different approaches to predict credit risk utilizing a dataset provided by LendingClub, a peer-to-peer lending service.

We will review the performance of each model and arrive at a recommendation whether any of the models are suitable for use.

# Results
Below are the balanced accuracy scores and imbalanced classification reports for each machine learning model we tested:

# Summary
Our ideal model will balance accuracy and recall, or sometimes referred to as sensitivity. While a high score in each area would indicate that the model is a strong predictor of credit risk, we may want to drill down into sensitivity on both low- and high-risk loans. Depending on the needs of the business, stakeholders might have a higher tolerance for either a more conservative model or one that is a little riskier.

-	Our first model, Random Oversampling, returned a Balanced Accuracy Score of 0.535 and a total recall score of 0.63.
-	SMOTE (Synthetic Minority Oversampling Technique) Oversampling returned a Balanced Accuracy Score of 0.598 and a total recall score of 0.67.
-	Undersampling returned a Balanced Accuracy Score of 0.559 and a total recall score of 0.52.
-	SMOTEENN returned a Balanced Accuracy Score of 0.608 and a total recall score of 0.57
-	Our Balanced Random Forest Classifier model returned a Balanced Accuracy Score of 0.998 and a total recall score of 1.00.
-	And finally, the Easy Ensemble AdaBoost Classifier model returned a Balanced Accuracy Score of 1.0 and a total recall score of 1.0.

## Recommendations
Based on our findings above, we recommend the East Ensemble AdaBoost Classifier model due to the modelâ€™s high accuracy and sensitivity/recall performance. This model will accurately predict credit risk for both high- and low-risk loans.
